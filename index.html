  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! Iâ€™m <strong>Dr. Kavita Rani</strong> â€” or just Kavita if you like it simpler.  
    A nuclear physicist by profession, a storyteller by soul, and a woman whoâ€™s proud to live her contradictions out loud.
  </p>
  <p>
    I come from a small town in <strong>Punjab, India</strong> â€” the land of warmth, rhythm, and roti.  
    And yes, my name "Kavita" literally means "poetry" in Hindi, though Iâ€™ve always been more into <em>stories</em> than verses.
  </p>
  <p>
    A convent-educated girl, I completed my high school in 2009 with a science major, then went on to earn my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in Physics by 2014.  
    Fueled by a deep love for the nucleus (not metaphorically â€” literally), I earned my Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics from <strong>Panjab University</strong> in 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, I work as a <strong>Research Assistant Professor</strong> in the <strong>Heavy Ion Laboratory in Warsaw</strong>, studying fusion dynamics through quasi-elastic barrier distribution and transfer channel cross-sections.  
    But beyond the lab coat and code, I am a creator.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love <strong>coding</strong> â€” C, C++, Python â€” and recently Iâ€™ve been exploring the world of machine learning.  
    Iâ€™m also obsessed with <strong>fashion</strong>, <strong>dancing</strong>, especially <em>Bhangra</em> and freestyle, and <strong>Punjabi folk music</strong>.  
    I may have forgotten all the classical dance I learned in school, but I never forgot how to move freely to lifeâ€™s beat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m married to the most wonderful man in the world â€” seriously.  
    Heâ€™s in the <strong>Indian Navy</strong> and while long distance sucks, the love doesnâ€™t. ðŸ’™  
    I have one brother and two sisters, and I adore their kids even more than I love them (yes, I said it ðŸ˜„).
  </p>
  <p>
    I lost my parents â€” my mother early in life, and my father recently in 2024.  
    I donâ€™t speak of this often, but I do believe someday Iâ€™ll live a life with just them again â€” somewhere, somehow.
  </p>
  <p>
    Living far from my family â€” in another city, country, continent â€” has made me stronger, more independent, and maybe even a little wiser.  
    This space is my way of connecting with others who feel the weight of distance and the warmth of memories.
